# Launch my personal website

In these days I was trying to start my personal website, it is open to the public. Open your browser and navigate to [https://hantsy.github.io](https://hantsy.github.io). In  this post, I will simply introduce how I created it using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  

I have written a lot of blog entries on [blogspot](https://hantsy.blogspot.com) and  [Medium](https://hantsy.medium.com) in the past years, the new home page will be a central place to aggregate all resources, including blog entries, development notes, etc.

## Personal Homepage

Follow the guide of  [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) , firstly create a repository named `<your github name>.github.io`, it will be built by GitHub Pages workflow and deployed to `https://<your github name>.github.io`.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is use for building static website and blog from markdown text documents. Github Pages has built-in Jekyll support.  

Jekyll online documents has a great [step-by-step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) to help you to setup a Jekyll driven static website from scratch. Once you have understand how Jekyll works, you can choose an existing template or themes to speed up the website building.  There are a plenty of themes in [Jekyll showcases](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/) and [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) which can reuse in your website. After researching I finally choose [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

The best way to reuse  [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) is cloning it and renaming to  `<your github name>.github.io`.  But I've created repository(`hantsy.github.io`).  When I cloned it into my local disk, and tried to push the existing repository,  and encountered a small issue, check [alshedivat/al-folio#208](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/208).

The  [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) includes two branches: `source` and `master`. Any modifications should be done in the source branch, it included a Github actions to deploy the build result to the master branch.

The next step is to configure the basic information.  Open `_config.yml` in the project root folder,  set the essential  properties, eg.  first_name, last_name, description etc. And change the profile info in the  `about` page, replace the your photo in the about page.

## Import Medium Posts

I have maintained my current blog on https://hantsy.medium.com , I do not want to duplicate the work and republish all posts on the `posts` page again.  The best way is to sync the posts automatically. 

After researching myself  and discussing with the Jekyll gurus from [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com), I decided to use the [official RSS Importer](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/rss/) in a standalone [Github actions workflow](https://github.com/hantsy/hantsy.github.io/blob/source/.github/workflows/medium-sync.yml) to sync the posts.

The solution is not ideal but works.  It will be changed in the future if I found better solutions.

## Display Github Projects

The [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) itself includes a jekyll-github-metadata plugin to access the   metadata of Github repositories.

To replace projects in the  `projects` page, I changed the  `_pages/projects.md` to the following.

```markdown
---
layout: page
title: projects
permalink: /projects/
description: A growing collection of my personal cool stuff.
nav: true
---

<div class="projects">

  {% assign sorted_projects = site.github.public_repositories | sort: "stargazers_count"|reverse  %}
  {% for project in sorted_projects %}
  <div class="card hoverable mt-2">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title text-lowercase">
        <a href="{{ project.html_url }}" target="_blank">{{ project.name }}</a>
      </h5>
       <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">{{project.language}} &bull; <i class="fa fa-star"></i> {{project.stargazers_count}} </h6>
      <p class="card-text">{{ project.description }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

Reading the public repositories does not a Github authentication.

## Gather All Docs

In the past years, I have written a plenty of docs via blog entries, project wikis, etc.  The Github Pages also support Jekyll driven static web pages.   Check the project settings  page, there is *Github Pages*, set it to discover docs from `master` branch and *docs* folder. After it is set, created a `index.md` in the *docs* folder, generally it should a table of content for all documents in the *docs* folder.

After it is done, the *docs* for the single project is available via *http://hantsy.github.io/<your project name>*, eg.  [https://hantsy.github.io/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate/](https://hantsy.github.io/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate/) is the online docs address for the repository [hantsy/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate).

Some docs them are originally hosted on GitBook.io which provide better UI to read it in the browsers.

The [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) itself includes a `publications` page and enables  `jekyll-scholar` to display the essays, books, etc. I reuse it to organize my docs.

Go to the [publications](https://hantsy.github.io/publications/) to browse all the docs I have gathered.
