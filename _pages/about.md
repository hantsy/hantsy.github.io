Hi, my name is Hantsy, a passionate independent freelancer from China. I have over 18 years of experience in software engineering and focused on Java EE/Jakarta EE and Spring ecosystem. I am also a blogger, Twitter, and open-source contributor. I have shared plenty of codes via Github.
In 2012, I was invited to attend the JBoss User and Developer Conference in Boston and received the 2012 JBoss Community Recognition Awards by Redhat.

Currently, I live in Guangzhou, China.

<p class="text-secondary display-5">I am available for new opportunities.</p>
