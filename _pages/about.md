## architecture and engineering experience

* Hands-on experience of the mainstream software architecture patterns, including REST, CQRS, Event-Driven Architecture(AMQP, Rabbit MQ, Apache ActiveMQ/Artemis, Apache Kafka), Enterprise Integration Pattern(EIP)(Apache Camel, Spring Integration), Microservices, etc.
* Plenty of agile development experience, esp. practical experience of Github Flow( branch for new issues, pull request, code review, etc.) to deliver software faster and more reliable.
* Embracing geek culture, such as XP/TDD, and familiarity with the most popular CI/CD service, e.g. Circle CI, Github actions, Travis, Shippable, etc.
* Good command of cloud-native application development, and skilled in Docker, K8s to containerize applications.
* Experience in modernizing legacy applications and migration to the newest tech stack.

## application development and programming practice

* Java 8+(Optional, Stream, Future, etc), Kotlin, basic knowledge of Scala
* JUnit 5, Mockito, TestContainers, RestAssured, WireMock, JsonPath, HtmlUnit/WebDriver etc.
* Java EE/Jakarta EE specifications(EJB, JPA, CDI, JSF, JaxRS, Arquillian testing with Glassfish/Payara, WildFly/JBossEAP, OpenLiberty, etc.), Microprofile, Quarkus, Helidon, Vertx
* Spring Stack(WebMVC, WebFlux, Session, Data, Security, Integration, AMQP, Batch, etc.), Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Boot Test.
* Popular RDBMS(H2, MySQL, Postgres, MSSQL, Oracle, etc) and NoSQLs(Mongo, Redis, Neo4j, Cassandra, Couchbase, Elasticsearch etc).
* Reactive Streams, and Reactive Programming(Rxjava, Reactor)
* Design and implement RESTful APIs archived Richardson Mature Model(Level 2 or Level 3)
* PHP(Doctrine, Symfony, PHPUnit, etc), NodeJS(NPM/Yarn, Typescript, Angular, NestJS, Jest)

## team leadership and coaching
* Screening CVs, and interview candidates for customers to build a startup team.
* Defining project plan(Scrum sprints plan), participating in business requirement analysis, and leading the team to incubate the MVP product for startups.
* Creating small POC projects to demonstrate new techniques, technology stack, and better methods.
* Coaching practice of agile/scrum development(beyond Agile concept), eg. applying Github Flow(branches for tasks, PR, code review, CI/CD, etc.) into agile/Scrum to contribute new codes more effectively.
* Good problem-resolving capabilities, eg. searching and exploring on StackOverflow, and asking help from the upstream developers.
