Hi, my name is Hantsy, a passionate independent freelancer from China. I have over 18 years of experience in software engineering and focused on Java EE/Jakarta EE and Spring ecosystem. I am also a blogger, Twitter, and open-source contributor. I have shared plenty of codes via Github.
In 2012, I was invited to attend the JBoss User and Developer Conference in Boston and received the 2012 JBoss Community Recognition Awards by Redhat.

Currently, I live in Guangzhou, China.

My dream job is :

* Embrace engineering culture and geek culture,  result-oriented,  no meetings.

* Build great Agile/Scrum principles at your pace, not obeyed all of  the rules from a Scrum master course.

* Believe in smart collaboration tools(including paid cloud service) is the key of effective communication and high productivity.

  

<p class="text-secondary display-5">I am available for new opportunities.</p>
