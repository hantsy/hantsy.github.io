Hi, my name is Hantsy, a passionate independent freelancer from China. I have over 18 years of experience in software engineering and focused on Java EE/Jakarta EE and Spring ecosystem. I am also a blogger, Twitter, and open-source contributor. I have shared plenty of codes via Github.
In 2012, I was invited to attend the JBoss User and Developer Conference in Boston and received the 2012 JBoss Community Recognition Awards by Redhat.

Currently, I live in Guangzhou, China.

My dream job is :

* Work anywhere on the earth. 
* Embrace engineering culture,  no meetings.

* Always be agile, build  a compatible Agile/Scrum principles at your pace, not obeyed all of  the rules from a Scrum master course.

* Effective communication is key to produce high productivity, believe in great collaboration tools(including paid cloud service) is more important than face-to-face distributed chat.

* Embrace challenges in daily work, always try to update the latest tech stack and give a shot to the new things.
