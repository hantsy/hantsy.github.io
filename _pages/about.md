Hi, my name is Hantsy, a passionate independent freelancer from China. I have over 18 years of experience in software engineering and focused on Java EE/Jakarta EE and Spring ecosystem. I am also a blogger, Twitter, and open-source contributor. I have shared plenty of codes via Github.
In 2012, I was invited to attend the JBoss User and Developer Conference in Boston and received the 2012 JBoss Community Recognition Awards by RedHat.

Currently, I live in Guangzhou, China.

What is my dream job?

* Work anywhere on the earth.
* Alwasy be agile, build your own Agile/Scrum principle at your pace, not obey all rules from a Scrum master course.
* Embrace engineering culture, no meetings, always use the cutting-edge collaboration tools including paid cloud service to replace the tedious chat or video call.
* Embrace geek culture, like challenges in daily work and always try to update the latest tech stack and give a shot to the new things.
* Emphasize time management and self-management, not follow stupid project management certification course.
