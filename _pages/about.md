Hi, my name is Hantsy, a passionate independent freelancer from China. I have over 18 years of experience in software engineering and focused on Java EE/Jakarta EE and Spring ecosystem. I am also a blogger, Twitter, and open-source contributor. I have shared plenty of codes via Github.
In 2012, I was invited to attend the JBoss User and Developer Conference in Boston and received the 2012 JBoss Community Recognition Awards by Redhat.

Currently, I live in Guangzhou, China.

My dream job is :

* Work anywhere on the earth. 
* Always be agile, build  your own Agile/Scrum principle at your pace, not obeyed all of  the rules from a Scrum master course.
* Effective communication is the key to produce high productivity, use the great collaboration tools including paid cloud service to replace the tedious chat or vedio call.
* Embrace challenges in daily work, always try to update the latest tech stack and give a shot to the new things.
* Embrace engineering culture, emphasize time management and self-management,  no meetings.
