Hi, my name is Hantsy, a passionate independent freelancer from China. I have 20-year experience in software engineering, and I am mainly focusing on Java EE/Jakarta EE and Spring ecosystem. 

I am also a blogger, twitter, and open-source contributor. In the past 2020, I have contributed over 100k lines of open-source codes via Github.

In 2012, I was invited to attend the JBoss User and Developer Conference in Boston and received the 2012 JBoss Community Recognition Awards by RedHat(now division of IBM).

Currently, I live in Guangzhou, China.

What is my dream job?

* Be able to work anywhere on the earth.
* Always be agile, build your own Agile/Scrum principle at your pace, not obey all rules from a Scrum Master course.
* Believe in engineering culture, no meetings, always use the professional collaboration tools to replace the tedious chat or video call.
* Advocate geek culture, embrace challenges in daily work and always try to update the latest tech stack and give a shot to the cutting-edge technologies.
* Emphasize on time management and self-management, flexible working time.
